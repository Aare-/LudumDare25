HI!

This is my ludum dare entry for 25 Ludum Dare themed "You are the villain"
You play as the small kitty, the goal of this game is to make 14 poops, without beeing catched by the inmates.

To move kitty around use WSAD or arrows, to make poop pres and hold space.
Inmates gets suspicious when they see You making poop or while beeing inside the green circle that sorounds poop, so avoid that or the game will end.

You get more points when green circles sorrounding poops doesn't touch, so try to spread your faecals evenly across the flat.

Sidenote, I spent way too much time drawing the background, so the graphic design of this game may be a little bit uneven at few places - sorry for that.

GL;HF :D
